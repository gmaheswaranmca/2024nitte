#static 
    1. static keyword is used to define private 
       variables to the module.
    2. static keyword is used to 
       define the long lasting local variable 
       memory allocatted only once 
       variable initialized only once 
       - used to maintain the local buffer wrt function 
       - generator function 
            to generate term in the number series 
                so that we will memorize the next number (buffer)

program to generate the term in the number series:
example: fibonacci sequence:

int fibb_term() { // generator 
    static int first=0, second=1;//pointers
    int next = first;
    int third = first + second;
    first = second;
    second = third;
    return next;
}

In "static int first=0, second=1;" 
first and second are memory allocatted only once 
and initialized once.

the changed static variables values will be memorized.
ie they are global to life, local to access 

"""STATIC variables are like global varaibles 
but access is private to the function"""


#global (external) with extern 
    extern keyword for name resoultion by modules 
    later allocated in main or parent modules
